  <div class="directions">
    <p>Preheat oven to 375°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.</p>
    <p>Sprinkle each half of squash with 1/4 tsp. salt, then place cut side down on prepared baking sheet. Bake until interior of squash is fork-tender, 40-50 minutes. Let cool.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, whisk fish sauce, brown sugar, ginger, garlic, 2 Tbsp. lime juice, and 1/2 tsp. salt in a large bowl. Transfer 3 Tbsp. fish sauce mixture to a shallow wide bowl. Add steak and turn to coat. Let sit at room temperature at least 30 minutes.</p>
    <p>Add jalapeño, sesame oil, and remaining 6 Tbsp. lime juice to remaining fish sauce mixture in large bowl and stir to combine.</p>
    <p>Using a fork, scrape squash crosswise to pull strands from shells into a large bowl; discard shells. Toss squash with 4 Tbsp. jalapeño sauce and remaining 1/2 tsp. salt.</p>
    <p>Heat vegetable oil in a large heavy skillet over high; pat steak dry. Working in batches if needed, sear steak until browned, about 3 minutes per side for medium-rare. Let rest 5 minutes, then thinly slice lengthwise against the grain.</p>
    <p>Divide squash among bowls. Toss lettuce, carrot, cucumber, and bean sprouts in remaining jalapeño sauce, then arrange over squash. Add steak to bowls, then top with scallions, cilantro, and peanuts.</p>
    <p>Squash can be cooked 2 days ahead. Let cool completely, then store in an airtight container and chill. Steak can be marinated 1 day ahead. Store in a resealable plastic bag and chill.</p>
