    <ul>
      <li>3/4 cup hazelnuts</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons white wine vinegar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons fresh orange juice</li>
      <li>Kosher salt</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons plus 1 1/2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
      <li>3 Granny Smith or other crisp apples</li>
      <li>2 1/2 pounds endive, trimmed, leaves separated, cut in half crosswise if large</li>
      <li>1/2 pound daikon radishes, peeled, very thinly sliced, preferably using a mandolin</li>

    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="directions">
    <p> Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Toast hazelnuts on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing occasionally, until golden brown, 13-15 minutes.</p>
    <p> Wrap nuts in a kitchen towel and let steam 1 minute. Rub nuts in towel to remove loose skins (don't worry about skins that don't come off) and let cool.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, whisk vinegar, orange juice, and 2 tsp. salt in a medium bowl, then whisk in 3 Tbsp. oil in a slow, steady stream.</p>
    <p>Coarsely chop cooled nuts. Toss with remaining 1 1/2 tsp. oil and a pinch of salt in a large wide bowl. Core and thinly slice apples; add to bowl along with endive and radishes.</p>
    <p>Drizzle dressing over salad. Gently but thoroughly toss just until salad is evenly dressed; adjust seasonings. Divide salad among serving plates. Top with cheese and pomegranate seeds.</p>
    <p>Nuts can be toasted and cooled up to 3 days ahead. Keep covered at room temperature.</p>
