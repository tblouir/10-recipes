  <div class="ingredients">
    <ul>
      <li>8 ounces American Neufchâtel or reduced-fat cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
      <li>1/3 cup sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 cup light coconut milk</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon pure coconut extract</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons sweetened coconut flakes</li>
      <li>'4 cups 1/2-inch cubes store-bought angel food cake</li>
      <li>Peel of 1 lime, cut into 1/8-inch-wide strips (optional)</li>
      <li>'1/3 cup plus 2 teaspoons sugar, divided (optional)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="directions">
    <p>In a bowl, combine Neufchâtel 1/3 cup sugar, milk and coconut extract.</p>
    <p>Heat oven to 350°F.</p>
    <p>Spread coconut evenly on a baking sheet; toast, stirring once or twice, until golden, 5 to 10 minutes.</p>
    <p>In each of four 8-ounce serving glasses, divide and layer half of coconut cream, half of cake cubes and half of toasted coconut; repeat with remaining cream, cake and coconut.</p>
    <p>Refrigerate at least 1 hour or up to 24.</p>
    <p>If garnishing with candied lime: Bring a half-full small pot of water to a boil. Place lime peels in a small mesh sieve; set over pot to submerge peels; boil 2 minutes.</p>
    <p>Remove sieve and run peels under cold water. Repeat boiling and cooling process with fresh water. Refill same pot with 1/3 cup fresh water and 1/3 cup sugar; bring to a boil.</p>
    <p>Place sieve over pot so peels are submerged; reduce heat to medium and simmer 5 minutes.</p>
    <p>Pat peels dry with a paper towel; in a bowl, toss with remaining 2 teaspoons sugar to coat. Top trifles with candied peels; serve.</p>
